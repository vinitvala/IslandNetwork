# IslandNetwork Traffic Modelling Tool

## Project Overview

The Traffic Congestion Modeling Tool is a Java-based simulator designed to analyze and predict traffic flows and congestion in city networks. It computes the optimal paths and traffic capacities between cities using sophisticated algorithms. This tool is invaluable for urban planning and congestion management.

## Key Features

- Maximum Flow Calculation: Utilizes Depth First Search (DFS) and the Ford-Fulkerson method to determine the maximum number of cars that can traverse between two cities without exceeding road capacities.
- Shortest Path Determination: Implements Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the most efficient routes between cities, minimizing travel time and congestion.

## Dependencies
 Java Development Kit (JDK 11 or later) <br>
 Apache Maven (3.6.3 or later) <br>

 ## Installation
 Clone the repo
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/vinitvala/IslandNetwork
 ```

## Usage
This tool requires a list of cities and roads with specified carrying capacities (cars per minute). Execute the simulator through the command line to analyze traffic flow and determine efficient routing and capacity handling across the network.

## Sample Execution
Upon launching the application, users are greeted with the following interface:
